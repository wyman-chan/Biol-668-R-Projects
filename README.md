# Biol-668-R-Projects

# Overview
This repository contains R scripts and analyses completed for the Biol-668: Advanced Bioinformatics course. The projects showcase various statistical and bioinformatics techniques using the R programming language, focusing on genomic data interpretation, visualization, and data wrangling.

Project 1: Analysis of Bacterial Abundance and Diversity over Time

Objective: To explore the distribution, transformation, correlation, and diversity of bacterial species (Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Leptotrichia) in relation to sampling time and environmental depth. The analysis includes testing for normality, transformations, ANOVA for time effects, correlation among species, linear modeling, and ordination techniques.

Output: The project reveals  trends and relationships between bacterial species and depth. It includes histograms and Q-Q plots for normality checks, transformed variables to meet assumptions, ANOVA tests showing correlation analyses between species, linear regression models linking species to depth, diversity indices (Shannon), rarefaction analyses, and NMDS ordination plots visualizing community composition based on Bray-Curtis distances.
