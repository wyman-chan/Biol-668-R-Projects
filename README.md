# Biol-668-R-Projects

# Overview
This repository contains R scripts and analyses completed for the Biol-668: Advanced Bioinformatics course. The projects showcase various statistical and bioinformatics techniques using the R programming language, focusing on genomic data interpretation, visualization, and data wrangling.

# Contents
Part 1: Analysis of Bacterial Abundance and Diversity over Time

To explore the distribution, transformation, correlation, and diversity of bacterial species. The analysis includes testing for normality, transformations, ANOVA for time effects, correlation among species, linear modeling, and ordination techniques. The project shows trends and relationships between bacterial species and depth. It includes histograms and Q-Q plots for normality checks, transformed variables to meet assumptions, ANOVA tests showing correlation analyses between species, linear regression models linking species to depth, and NMDS ordination plots visualizing community composition based on Bray-Curtis distances.


Part 2: Analysis of Grassland Plant Communities

To analyze how plant community composition, phylogenetic structure, and functional trait diversity in a grassland ecosystem vary with environmental factors. The project integrates community ecology, trait evolution, and phylogenetics to assess biodiversity patterns and ecological structure. This project produces a wide range of ecological insights. These analyses collectively demonstrate how environmental gradients shape plant community assembly via ecological, evolutionary, and functional dimensions.
